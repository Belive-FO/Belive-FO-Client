# Belive-FO-Client Project Rules

## Stack and architecture
- This is a single Next.js app (not monorepo).
- Use flat structure under `src/`:
  - `src/app` for routes/layouts
  - `src/features` for feature modules
  - `src/shared` for shared logic (stores, hooks, lib, types)
  - `src/components` for UI/shared components
- Do not introduce `apps/*`, `packages/*`, or `@belive/*` package imports.

## Consistency and project alignment
- Always comply with the standards defined in **[AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md)**

## Import and path conventions
- Prefer path aliases:
  - `@/*`
  - `@/features/*`
  - `@/shared/*`
  - `@/components/*`
- Keep import paths consistent with current tsconfig.

## Branding and product language
- Product name is `FlowOffice`.
- Primary login/social icon is `public/images/logos/Lark.png`.
- Do not reintroduce "Modernize" branding unless explicitly requested.

## Auth and integration assumptions
- Lark OAuth is primary social auth path.
- Event bus exists as a placeholder (`src/shared/lib/event-bus.ts`) and should not be treated as fully implemented.
- If implementing event-driven logic, either implement event bus properly or document as planned.

## Code quality
- TypeScript strict mode friendly changes only.
- Keep components small and focused; avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Prefer existing UI primitives from `src/components/ui`.
- After substantive edits, run lint checks for changed files.

## Documentation sync
- If architecture/path/branding changes, update docs:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/01-overview.md`
  - `docs/02-implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/03-complete-guide.md`
- Docs must reflect actual project state, not aspirational monorepo structure.
